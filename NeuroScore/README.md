# Neurodevelopmental disorder dysregulation score 

In this repo, I am analysing the data by Velmeshev et al (2019), which looked at single-nucleus RNA-seq of post-mortem brains of ASD patients.

Folders in this repo: 

* Autism: contains code for explatory analysis of the scRNA-seq data

* Scoring: contains the code for the NDD dysregulation score
