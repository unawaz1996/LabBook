\title{Spatiotempotal properties of NDD genes during development}
\maketitle



what to review

\begin{itemize}
    \item human brain single cell rna-seq studies 
    \item reread papers used for PhD proposal 
    \item number and types of samples 
    \item method used for sequencing 
    \item data availablity 
    \item main conclusions of the studies
    \item this kind of analysis in other areas
\end{itemize}


\section{Introduction}

main points to cover 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Brain development 
\end{itemize}


\section{Neurodevelopmental disoders}
\section{Co-mobidity of NDDs}
\section{Expression studies}
\begin{itemize}

 \item what are the datasets available 
\item where am i going to get the genelists from 
\item what gene ontologies am I getting with my genes 
\item current co-expression networks that are available
\item lack of ID gene networks 
\item benchmark potentially?
\item Issues with bulk rna? 

\end{itemize}
\section{Thesis aims}

\begin{itemize}
    \item To comprehensively characterize the expression properties of ID and CP enes in the normal human brain
    \begin{itemize}
        \item To determine whether ID and CP genes are expressed in a cell-type speciic mannner using single-cell RNA-seq data
        \item To characterize the developmental trajectory of gene expression for ID and CP genes and assess their expression during cellular maturation in brain organiods and assess their expression across multiple fetail developmental periods 
        \item  To characterize the spatial and temporal properties of ID and CP gene expression in the adult brain, by assessing age-dependent changes  brain-region and cortical layer-specificity 
        
    \end{itemize}

    \item To determine whether convergent gene expression changes are observed in ID and CP in patient-derived cells with heterogenous mutations 

\end{itemize}
