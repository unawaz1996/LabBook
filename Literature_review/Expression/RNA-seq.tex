    \section{Use of expression studies in deciphering NDDs and the brain in general}
    Although the genetic etiology of NDDs is far from being completely known, significant advances have been made in the last years in understanding specific biological pathways underlying the molecular mechanisms of these illnesses. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In this review, I will start by summarizing expression studies that have contributed to our understanding of brain functions
    \end{itemize}

The first study to understand gene expression in the brain
